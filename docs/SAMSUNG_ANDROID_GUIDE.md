## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Could not scan QR code from image"**

**Possible reasons:**
1. Image is blurry - retake a clearer photo
2. QR code is too small - get closer
3. QR code is not fully visible - capture entire QR
4. Wrong type of QR - must be from PayApp

**Solutions:**
- Take a clearer screenshot
- Make sure entire QR code is visible
- Increase screen brightness before screenshot
- Try zooming in on the QR before screenshot

### **Camera Scanner Still Won't Work**

**Try these in order:**

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```
   Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   Select "Cached images" and "Cookies"
   Clear data, then refresh PayApp
   ```

2. **Try Different Browser**
   ```
   If using Chrome → Try Samsung Internet
   If using Samsung Internet → Try Chrome
   ```

3. **Check if Camera Works in Other Apps**
   ```
   Open Camera app
   Take a photo
   If camera doesn't work → Phone camera issue
   If camera works → Browser permission issue
   ```

4. **Restart Browser**
   ```
   Force close browser
   Clear from recent apps
   Open browser again
   Go to PayApp
   ```

5. **Just Use Upload Method!**
   ```
   It's easier and always works 😊
