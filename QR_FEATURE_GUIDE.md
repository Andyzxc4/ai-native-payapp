## Features Implemented

### 1. **Tab-Based Navigation**
   - The dashboard now has three tabs:
     - **Send Money**: Original payment sending functionality

### 3. **Network Accessibility**
   - Server now listens on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
   - Automatically detects your local network IP address
   - Displays both localhost and network URLs on startup

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

You'll see output like:
```
üöÄ Payment Application running on:

2. Log in with your credentials (e.g., alice@example.com / password123)

### Step 3: Generate QR Code

2. The QR code will automatically generate
3. You'll see:
   - A scannable QR code
   - The full network URL
   - Your network IP address
   - The port number
   - Instructions on how to use it

### Step 4: Access from Mobile
1. **Ensure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network** as your computer
2. Open your phone's camera app
3. Point it at the QR code on your screen
4. Tap the notification that appears
5. Log in with your credentials
6. You can now send and receive payments from your phone!

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/generate-qr` - Generates QR codes with network information
- **QR Library**: Uses `qrcode` npm package for QR generation
- **Network Detection**: Automatically detects local network IP using Node.js `os` module
- **Server Binding**: Changed from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to accept connections from all network interfaces

### Frontend Changes
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean, modern tab interface using Tailwind CSS
- **QR Display**: Beautiful card-based layout with gradient backgrounds
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while QR code is being generated
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all screen sizes
- **Instructions**: Built-in help text for users

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:
1. The app is now accessible to anyone on your local network
2. Always ensure you're on a trusted network (e.g., home Wi-Fi)
3. Do not use on public Wi-Fi networks
4. The session management requires login on each device
5. For production use, implement HTTPS and proper authentication

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code doesn't scan
- Make sure the QR code is fully visible on screen
- Try increasing your screen brightness
- Ensure your phone camera is clean and focused

### Can't connect from phone
- Verify both devices are on the **same Wi-Fi network**
- Check if your router allows device-to-device communication
- Some corporate/public networks block inter-device connections
- Try disabling any VPN on either device
- Restart your router if needed

### Wrong IP address shown
- Click "Regenerate QR Code" button
- Restart the server if you changed networks
- Check your network settings if multiple network adapters are present
