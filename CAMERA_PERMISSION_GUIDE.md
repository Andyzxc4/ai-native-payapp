## 🔧 Troubleshooting Camera Issues

### **Problem: No Permission Popup**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Already denied in past
2. Browser doesn't support camera
3. Site not trusted

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Reset Site Permissions
```
iPhone Safari:
Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
(or)
Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → Remove specific site

Android Chrome:
Chrome → Settings → Site Settings → All Sites
Find your site → Clear & Reset
```

#### Option 2: Check Browser Settings
```
iPhone:
Settings → Safari → Camera → Allow

Android:
Settings → Apps → Chrome → Permissions → Camera → Allow
```

#### Option 3: Use Different Browser
- iPhone: Try Safari (recommended)
- Android: Try Chrome or Firefox

### **Problem: Camera Permission Denied**

You'll see an error message and hear: "Camera access failed. Please check your browser permissions."

**Fix:**
1. Look for camera icon in address bar
2. Click it and select "Allow"
3. Refresh the page
4. Try "Start Camera Scanner" again

### **Problem: Camera Starts But Won't Scan**

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ QR code is clear and visible
- ✅ Hold steady for 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Not too close or too far (about 15-30cm)
- ✅ QR code fills the scan box
- ✅ Screen brightness at 100%

### **Problem: HTTPS Error**

Some browsers require HTTPS for camera access.

**Current Setup:** You're using HTTP (http://192.168.86.6:3000)

**If camera doesn't work:**
1. The code now explicitly requests permission first
2. Voice feedback will tell you if it failed
3. Error message will guide you to settings

**For Production:** Set up HTTPS/SSL certificate
